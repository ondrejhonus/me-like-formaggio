Prep time: 10 minutes  
Rest time: 60 minutes  
Cooking time: 15 minutes  

### Ingredients
- [ ] 2¼ cups all-purpose flour (plus extra for dusting)
- [ ] 1 tsp sea salt
- [ ] 1½ tsp baking powder
- [ ] ½ tsp baking soda
- [ ] 1 tsp sugar
- [ ] 2 tbsp olive oil
- [ ] ⅓ cup unsweetened plant-based yogurt 
- [ ] ~½ cup warm water (adjust as needed)
- [ ] Olive oil or butter, for brushing

### Steps
1. **Mix the dry stuff:** In a bowl, combine flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and sugar. Stir well.

2. **Add wet ingredients:** Mix in olive oil and plant yogurt. Gradually add warm water, stirring until a shaggy dough forms.

3. **Knead:** Knead on a lightly floured surface for about 5 minutes, until smooth and slightly tacky.

4. **Rest:** Return dough to the bowl, cover with a clean towel, and let rest at room temperature for 1 hour.

5. **Shape:** Divide dough into 6 balls. Roll each out into a teardrop or oval shape, about ¼ inch thick.

6. **Cook:**  
   Heat a skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium-high heat.  
   Place a naan on the dry pan. Cook for 1–2 minutes until bubbles form, then flip.  
   Cook the other side for 1–2 more minutes until golden and slightly blistered.

7. **Finish:** Brush with olive oil or melted butter. Serve hot, preferably with my <a href="/posts/other/curry/">curry</a>.
