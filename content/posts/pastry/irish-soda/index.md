### Ingredients (English / Czech)
- [ ] 250 g plain white flour / 250 g hladké bílé mouky
- [ ] 250 g plain wholemeal flour / 250 g celozrnné mouky
- [ ] 1 tsp salt / 1 lžička soli
- [ ] 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda (baking soda) / 1 lžička jedlé sody
- [ ] 400 ml buttermilk / 400 ml podmáslí

**Optional additions for enhanced flavor and texture:**
- [ ] 1 tbsp sugar / 1 lžíce cukru
- [ ] 1 tbsp wheat bran / 1 lžíce pšeničných otrub
- [ ] 1 tbsp rapeseed oil / 1 lžíce řepkového oleje

### Steps
1. **Preheat the Oven:** Set your oven to 200°C (fan oven 180°C) and line a baking tray with parchment paper.
2. **Combine Dry Ingredients:** In a large bowl, mix the white flour, wholemeal flour, salt, and bicarbonate of soda. If using, add the sugar and wheat bran.
3. **Add Buttermilk:** Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the buttermilk. Mix gently until a sticky dough forms. If the dough feels too dry, add a little more buttermilk.
4. **Shape the Dough:** Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and shape it into a round loaf. Handle the dough as little as possible to keep the bread tender.
5. **Prepare for Baking:** Place the shaped dough onto the prepared baking tray. Using a sharp knife, cut a deep cross on top of the loaf—this helps the bread cook evenly.
6. **Bake:** Bake in the preheated oven for 30–35 minutes, or until the loaf is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.
7. **Cool:** Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack before serving.
