I fell in love with this bread on my student exchange trip in Dublin - Ireland. I give props to the sweet lady, whose place i was staying at, I'll never forget that.

I never thought i could love bread, but here we are...

Prep time: 10 minutes

Cooking time: 35 minutes

### Ingredients
- [ ] 250 g plain white flour
- [ ] 250 g plain wholemeal flour
- [ ] 1 tsp salt
- [ ] 1 tsp baking soda
- [ ] 400 ml buttermilk

### Steps
1. Set your oven to 200°C and line a baking tray with parchment paper.
2. In a large bowl, mix the white flour, wholemeal flour, salt, and soda
3. Make a hole in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the buttermilk. Mix gently until a sticky dough forms. If the dough feels too dry, add a little more buttermilk.
4. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and shape it into a round loaf. Handle the dough as little as possible to keep the bread tender.
5. Place the shaped dough onto the prepared baking tray. Using a sharp knife, cut a cross on top of the loaf—this helps the bread cook evenly and it looks good.
6. Bake in the oven for 30–35 minutes, or until the loaf is golden brown
7. I know it's hard but let it cool off for a few minutes
