### What is this site?
This site is my personal collection of recipes that I've made and loved over the years. I always wanted to keep track of stuff i cook and decide to cook them again so here we are...

### Why my recipes?
I don't like to overcomplicate things. I make simple and fast to make recipes without any weird ingredients. So if you're like me and don't want to buy 20 different ingredients to make one meal, then i welcome to my website of vegetarian food.

Same with this website. It's very simple, no bullcrap, just everything you need to actually make the food.

### Can I steal your pictures and recipes?
Sure! I don't really care if you take my recipe and decide to share it or save it somewhere where you feel it's convenient. Plus it makes me happy when i see people making their own food instead of buying shitty food filled with chemicals and crap that doesn't even belong in food.

And if you're wondering (you're not) what's my favourite recipe, the Irish buttermilk soda bread takes the cake (or bread).
